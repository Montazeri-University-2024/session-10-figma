## Personal Statement

I am a student living in Iran. Due to financial restrictions and heavy international sanctions against Iran, it is not possible for me to pay the fee. With all these limitations, as a student, I am eager to learn UI and UX, and I am sure that this tool can improve my career and financial future. I would be very grateful if you let me use this magical tool to build my future and make the world better.
